Methodology (10%) - Can you explain your approach? Code Quality (10%) - Is your solution readable and documented? Partial Credit Partial solutions may receive partial credit Showing clear progress and methodology helps Document your attempts even if unsuccessful - ·· · · · 📤 Submission Requirements What to Submit For each cipher you solve:\nDecrypted plaintext - The decoded message Source code - Your breaking program/script Brief explanation - How your solution works (2-3 sentences) (Optional) Step-by-step process documentation How to Submit Submit via the event platform (details provided at event) Include team name and members on all submissions Submit each cipher separately as you solve them You can resubmit if you find errors Format Team Name: [Your Team Name] Team Members: [Names] Cipher: [Caesar/Vigenère/Substitution/Mystery] PLAINTEXT: [Your decrypted message here] METHOD EXPLANATION: [Brief explanation of your approach] SOURCE CODE: [Your code here] - ·· · · · 🎁 Prizes \u0026 Awards Grand Prize (Highest Total Score) Exclusive Code-A-Thon t-shirts for all team members Certificate of Achievement Recognition on the event website Bragging rights Category Awards Fastest Team - First to solve all codes Best Methodology - Most elegant solution Perseverance Award - Best effort and learning Everyone Wins All participants receive:\nEvent lanyard and sticker Access to solution walkthroughs after the event Experience with real cryptanalysis Free food and refreshments during event \"At Bletchley Park, the reward wasn't glory—it was the satisfaction of a problem solved. Also, occasionally tea and biscuits.\" - ·· · · · ❓ Frequently Asked Questions Registration \u0026 Eligibility Q: Do I need to register in advance?\nA: No advance registration required. Just show up at the event desk on the day.\nQ: I’m a freshman/non-CS major. Can I still participate?\nA: Absolutely!

You may use internet resources.\nAbout the Challenges Q: How difficult are the codes?\nA: They range from beginner-friendly (Caesar) to challenging (Mystery). All are solvable with the techniques taught on this website.\nQ: Will we get hints?\nA: Limited hints may be provided if teams are stuck, but try to solve independently first.\nQ: Can we use online cipher-breaking tools?\nA: You should implement your own solutions. Learning resources are fine; automated solvers are not.\nQ: What if we can’t solve all the ciphers?\nA: That’s okay! Solving even one or two is an achievement. Partial credit is awarded.\nDuring the Event Q: Can we leave and come back?\nA: Yes, but be mindful of the time limit. We recommend staying for the duration.\nQ: Will food be provided?\nA: Yes, refreshments and snacks will be available.\nQ: Can we listen to music while working?\nA: Yes, use headphones to not disturb others.\nQ: Can we talk to other teams?\nA: Socializing is fine, but don’t share solutions or specific approaches.\nAfter the Event Q: Will solutions be published?\nA: Yes, after the event, we’ll release detailed solution walkthroughs.\nQ: Can we keep the code we write?\nA: Yes, you own your code. We encourage you to share it (after the event) as learning resources.\nQ: What if we disagree with our score?\nA: You can request a score review within 15 minutes of results posting.\n- ·· · · · 🚫 Code of Conduct Expected Behavior Treat all participants with respect Help create a welcoming, inclusive environment Focus on learning and collaboration Celebrate both your successes and others' Unacceptable Behavior Harassment or discrimination of any kind Cheating or academic dishonesty Intentionally disrupting others’ work Sharing solutions with other teams Consequences Violation of rules or code of conduct may result in:\nWarning Point deduction Disqualification from event Organizers have final say on all rulings.\n- ·· · · · 📞 Need Help?

<p><strong>Q: Do I need to register in advance?</strong><br>
A: No advance registration required. Just show up at the event desk on the day.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I&rsquo;m a freshman/non-CS major. Can I still participate?</strong><br>
A: Absolutely! All students are welcome, regardless of major or year.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I participate solo?</strong><br>
A: Yes, solo participation is allowed, though teams are encouraged for collaborative learning.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there an entry fee?</strong><br>
A: No, the event is completely free.</p>
<h3 id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#technical-requirements">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Q: What should I bring?</strong><br>
A: Bring your laptop with your preferred programming environment set up. Chargers recommended!</p>
<p><strong>Q: What programming languages can I use?</strong><br>
A: Any language you&rsquo;re comfortable with. Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, etc. are all fine.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need special software?</strong><br>
A: No special software required. A text editor and programming language interpreter/compiler are enough.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be internet access?</strong><br>

A: They range from beginner-friendly (Caesar) to challenging (Mystery). All are solvable with the techniques taught on this website.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will we get hints?</strong><br>
A: Limited hints may be provided if teams are stuck, but try to solve independently first.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can we use online cipher-breaking tools?</strong><br>
A: You should implement your own solutions. Learning resources are fine; automated solvers are not.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if we can&rsquo;t solve all the ciphers?</strong><br>
A: That&rsquo;s okay! Solving even one or two is an achievement. Partial credit is awarded.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can we listen to music while working?</strong><br>
A: Yes, use headphones to not disturb others.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can we talk to other teams?</strong><br>
A: Socializing is fine, but don&rsquo;t share solutions or specific approaches.</p>
<h3 id="after-the-event">After the Event<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#after-the-event">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Q: Will solutions be published?</strong><br>
A: Yes, after the event, we&rsquo;ll release detailed solution walkthroughs.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can we keep the code we write?</strong><br>
A: Yes, you own your code. We encourage you to share it (after the event) as learning resources.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if we disagree with our score?</strong><br>
A: You can request a score review within 15 minutes of results posting.</p>
