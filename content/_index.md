## 🎖️ Welcome to Operation Codebreaker

<div class="classified-stamp">TOP SECRET</div>

In the darkest days of World War II, the brilliant minds at **Bletchley Park** cracked the seemingly unbreakable Enigma code, turning the tide of history. Now, **you** have the opportunity to follow in their footsteps.

The **DataGators** and **ACM Club** at Allegheny College invite you to participate in an extraordinary coding challenge that combines historical codebreaking with modern computational thinking.

## 🔐 The Mission

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to decrypt a series of **encrypted messages** using any computational methods at your disposal. You'll encounter:

- **Caesar Ciphers** - The ancient Roman encryption method
- **Vigenère Ciphers** - The "unbreakable" polyalphabetic cipher
- **Substitution Ciphers** - Pattern recognition challenges
- **Morse Code** - The telegraph language of WWII
- **And more mysterious codes...** 🕵️

Each code presents unique challenges requiring different approaches. Teams will design, implement, and execute software solutions to crack these codes faster and more efficiently than their competitors.

<div class="alert-box">
⚠️ CHALLENGE LEVEL: These codes are challenging but achievable. Strategy, teamwork, and creative thinking are your greatest assets.
</div>

## 🏆 What You'll Win

The victorious codebreakers will receive:
- Exclusive Code-A-Thon t-shirts
- Recognition as master codebreakers
- Bragging rights for eternity
- Additional surprise awards
