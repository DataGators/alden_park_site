## 📖 The Story Behind AldenPark

<div class="classified-stamp">Code Name: Alden Park</div>

<div class="typewriter">
"In 1939, as war clouds gathered over Europe, a secret facility at Bletchley Park became home to Britain's greatest minds. Their mission: break the unbreakable Enigma code. Against all odds, they succeeded—shortening the war by years and saving countless lives."
</div>

**Code-A-Thon: AldenPark** pays homage to these pioneering codebreakers while bringing their challenge into the modern era. Named as a nod to both Bletchley Park and Allegheny College, this event challenges students to combine historical codebreaking techniques with contemporary computational power.

## 🎯 What is Code-A-Thon?

Code-A-Thon: AldenPark is a **4-hour hackathon** where student teams race against time to decrypt multiple encrypted messages. Unlike traditional hackathons focused on building apps or websites, this event focuses on:

- **Cryptanalysis** - Understanding and breaking encryption schemes
- **Algorithm Design** - Creating efficient decryption methods
- **Problem Solving** - Applying computational thinking to historical puzzles
- **Teamwork** - Collaborating under pressure

### Event Format

```
Hour 1-2: Introduction, Team Formation, Code Distribution
Hour 2-5: Active Codebreaking Period
Hour 5-6: Final Submissions, Presentations & Award Ceremony
```

## 🔐 The Codes You'll Face

Participants will receive **at least five different encrypted messages**, each using a different classical cipher or encoding:

1. **Caesar Cipher** - A simple shift cipher used by Julius Caesar
2. **Vigenère Cipher** - A polyalphabetic substitution cipher
3. **Substitution Cipher** - A more complex monoalphabetic cipher
4. **Morse Code** - The telegraph encoding used extensively in WWII
5. **Mystery Cipher** - An additional challenge cipher (details classified)

Each successfully broken code earns points for your team. Speed, accuracy, and methodology all factor into scoring.

<div class="alert-box">
⚠️ IMPORTANT: You may use ANY programming language, ANY tools, and ANY resources. The goal is to break the code—how you do it is up to you!
</div>

## 👥 Who Can Participate?

- **All Allegheny College students** are welcome
- **Any major or year** - no prior cryptography experience required
