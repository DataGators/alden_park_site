## 🔐 The Ciphers of Code-A-Thon

<div class="classified-stamp">CLASSIFIED</div>

During the Code-A-Thon, you'll encounter several types of classical ciphers. Each presents unique challenges and requires different approaches to break. Study them carefully—knowledge is your first weapon.

### 1. [Caesar Cipher](/codes/caesar/)
**Difficulty:** ⭐ Beginner  
**Type:** Monoalphabetic Substitution  
**Origin:** Ancient Rome (50 BC)

The simplest shift cipher, where each letter is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. Named after Julius Caesar, who used it for military communications.

**Quick Example:**
```
Plain:  HELLO
Shift:  3
Cipher: KHOOR
```

---

### 2. [Vigenère Cipher](/codes/vigenere/)
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐ Intermediate  
**Type:** Polyalphabetic Substitution  
**Origin:** 16th Century France

Once considered "le chiffre indéchiffrable" (the unbreakable cipher), the Vigenère uses a keyword to create multiple Caesar shifts. Each letter of the keyword determines the shift for corresponding plaintext letters.

**Quick Example:**
```
Plain:   ATTACK AT DAWN
Key:     LEMON
Cipher:  LXFOPV EF RNHR
```

---

### 3. [Substitution Cipher](/codes/substitution/)
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐ Intermediate  
**Type:** Monoalphabetic Substitution  
**Origin:** Medieval Period

Each letter is replaced with another letter according to a fixed substitution alphabet. Unlike Caesar, the substitution pattern can be random, making it more resistant to simple frequency analysis.

**Quick Example:**
```
Plain Alphabet:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher Alphabet: ZEBRASCDFGHIJKLMNOPQTUVWXY
Plain:           HELLO WORLD
Cipher:          GDKKN VNQKR
```

---

### 4. [Morse Code](/codes/morse/)
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐ Beginner-Intermediate  
**Type:** Character Encoding  
**Origin:** 1830s-1840s

Morse code isn't a cipher—it's an encoding scheme that represents text as sequences of dots and dashes. Used extensively in WWI and WWII for telegraph and radio communication, it's essential for any aspiring codebreaker.

**Quick Example:**
```
Plain:  SOS
Morse:  ··· −−− ···
Audio:  dit-dit-dit dah-dah-dah dit-dit-dit
```

### 5. [Mystery Cipher](/codes/mystery/)
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Advanced  
**Type:** CLASSIFIED  
**Origin:** To Be Determined

## 🎯 Choosing Your Approach

Each team will receive all cipher challenges simultaneously. You can:

1. **Sequential Approach** - Tackle codes one at a time, easiest to hardest
2. **Parallel Approach** - Split your team to work on multiple codes
3. **Strategic Approach** - Analyze all codes first, then prioritize based on team strengths

<div class="typewriter">
"At Bletchley Park, different teams specialized in different cipher types. What will your strategy be?"
</div>

## 📊 Scoring System

Points are awarded based on:
- **Correctness** - Did you decrypt the message accurately?
- **Speed** - How quickly did you break the code?
- **Method** - Did you document your approach?
- **Bonus Challenges** - Additional points for exceptional solutions
