## 🔐 Message from the Organizers

<div class="typewriter">
"Code-A-Thon: AldenPark exists because we believe that learning should be engaging, challenging, and fun. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting out, we want to create an experience that pushes you to think differently about problem-solving.

The codebreakers at Bletchley Park changed the course of history not through individual genius, but through collaboration, persistence, and creative thinking. We hope this event captures that spirit.

We're excited to see what you'll accomplish. See you at the hackathon!
