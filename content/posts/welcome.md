## 🎉 Welcome, Codebreakers!

<div class="classified-stamp">ATTENTION</div>

We're thrilled to announce **Code-A-Thon: AldenPark**, Allegheny College's first-ever code-breaking hackathon inspired by the legendary codebreakers of Bletchley Park!

### What's This All About?

During World War II, brilliant minds at Bletchley Park cracked the Nazi Enigma code, changing the course of history. Now, you have the chance to experience the thrill of cryptanalysis through a modern lens.

**Code-A-Thon: AldenPark** challenges student teams to:
- Decrypt multiple classical ciphers
- Build software solutions to break codes
- Apply computational thinking to historical puzzles
- Compete for prizes and recognition

### The Details

- **Duration:** 6-hour event on a Saturday afternoon
- **Team Size:** 1-4 members
- **Difficulty:** Accessible to all skill levels
- **Prizes:** T-shirts, awards, and eternal glory
