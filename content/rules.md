## 🔐 Challenge Rules

### The Codes

You will receive **at least four different encrypted messages**:
1. Caesar Cipher challenge
2. Vigenère Cipher challenge
3. Substitution Cipher challenge
4. Mystery Cipher challenge

### What You Can Use

**✅ ALLOWED:**
- Any programming language (Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, etc.)
- Any tools or software on your computer
- Online resources (documentation, Stack Overflow, tutorials)
- Reference materials and books
- Calculators and paper notes
- Collaboration within your team
- This website and its resources

**❌ NOT ALLOWED:**
- Communication with other teams about solutions
- Sharing code or answers between teams
- Using pre-written specific cipher-breaking code you wrote before the event
- Having others solve problems for you (online or in person)
- Automated online cipher-breaking tools (e.g., "decrypt this cipher for me" websites)

<div class="alert-box">
💡 CLARIFICATION: You CAN use online documentation, tutorials, and learning resources. You CANNOT use automated "paste-and-solve" websites. The goal is to understand and implement solutions, not just find answers.
</div>

### Honor Code

Participants must:
- Work honestly and with integrity
- Submit only work created during the event by their team
- Not interfere with other teams' work
- Respect the spirit of friendly competition

## 🏆 Scoring System

### Point Values

Each cipher has a base point value:

| Cipher | Base Points |
|--------|-------------|
| Caesar Cipher | 100 points |
| Vigenère Cipher | 250 points |
| Substitution Cipher | 200 points |
| Mystery Cipher | 300 points |
| **Total Possible** | **850 points** |

### Bonus Points

Additional points available for:
- **Speed Bonus** - First 3 teams to solve each cipher (50/30/10 pts)
- **Clean Code Bonus** - Well-documented, elegant solutions (up to 50 pts)
- **Complete Solve Bonus** - Solving all four ciphers (100 pts)

### Scoring Criteria

For each cipher:
1. **Correctness (80%)** - Did you decrypt the message accurately?
2. **Methodology (10%)** - Can you explain your approach?
3. **Code Quality (10%)** - Is your solution readable and documented?

### Partial Credit

- Partial solutions may receive partial credit
- Showing clear progress and methodology helps
- Document your attempts even if unsuccessful

<div class="morse-divider">-.. --. </div>

## 📤 Submission Requirements

### What to Submit

For each cipher you solve:

1. **Decrypted plaintext** - The decoded message
2. **Source code** - Your breaking program/script
3. **Brief explanation** - How your solution works (2-3 sentences)
4. **(Optional)** Step-by-step process documentation

### How to Submit

- Submit via the event platform (details provided at event)
- Include team name and members on all submissions
- Submit each cipher separately as you solve them
- You can resubmit if you find errors

### Format

```
Team Name: [Your Team Name]
